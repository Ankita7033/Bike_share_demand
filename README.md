# Bike_share_demand
Overview

This project analyzes bike share demand data to understand patterns and factors influencing bike rentals. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical insights to help optimize bike sharing services.



Dataset

The dataset contains 10,886 records with 23 features, including:

1.Temporal features: datetime, hour, day, month, year, dayofweek, weekend.

2.Weather features: season, weather, temp, atemp, humidity, windspeed.

3.Usage features: casual, registered, count (total rentals).

4.Derived features: hour_sin, hour_cos, temp_humidity, temp_windspeed, temp_bin,




Key Findings

1.Missing Values: No missing values in the dataset.

2.Target Variable (count):

   Mean: ~191.57 rentals

   Max: 977 rentals

   75th percentile: 284 rentals

   Visualizations: The notebook includes distribution plots and time-series analysis of bike demand.



Requirements:

1.Python 3.x

2.Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.



Steps:

1.Load the dataset (Bike_share_demand.ipynb).

2.Run EDA to understand data distributions.

3.Analyze demand patterns by time and weather factors.

4.Explore correlations between features.





Insights for Business:

1.Higher demand during certain hours/days.

2.Weather conditions significantly impact rentals.

3.Registered users show different patterns than casual users




Future Work:

1.Build predictive models for demand forecasting.

2.Analyze seasonal trends in-depth.

3.Optimize bike distribution based on usage patterns.



Files:

1.Bike_share_demand.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with full analysis.




How to Run:

1.Clone the repository.

2.Install required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt.

3.Open and run the Jupyter notebook.
